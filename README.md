## Description

Built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. This application has a purpose to put in practice my TS/JS skills.
I built this reading the [Nest docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/), watching a [NestJS crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqhNoDE6pb4) and a [Building a Custom URL Shortener Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z57566JBaZQ) video from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb).
